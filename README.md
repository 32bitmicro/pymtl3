# Pymtl-v3 working directory

Roadmap:
- [x] Update block only, explicit constraints 
- [x] Add method for hierarchy and explicit partial constraints
- [x] Add implicit constraints via variables at update block level
- [x] Make sure explicit total/partial constraints override implicit ones
- [x] Try out a Gcd module. Need a val/rdy source/sink though 
- [ ] Add "interface" to allow connections between components (ongoing)
- [ ] Make sure interface works with methods
